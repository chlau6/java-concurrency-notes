/*
You may think weâ€™re overstating the risk of deadlock because locks are usually held only briefly,
but deadlocks are a serious problem in real systems.
A production application may perform billions of lock acquire-release cycles per day.
Only one of those needs to be timed just wrong to bring the application to deadlock,
and even a thorough load-testing regimen may not disclose all latent deadlocks.
DemonstrateDeadlock in Listing 10.4 deadlocks fairly quickly on most systems.
