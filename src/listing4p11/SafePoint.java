/*
Letâ€™s construct another version of the vehicle tracker that publishes its underlying mutable state.
Again, we need to modify the interface a little bit to accommodate this change,
this time using mutable but thread-safe points.

SafePoint in Listing 4.11 provides a getter that retrieves both the x and y values at once by
returning a two-element array.

If we provided separate getters for x and y,
then the values could change between the time one coordinate is retrieved and the other,
resulting in a caller seeing an inconsistent value: an (x, y) location where the vehicle never was.

Using SafePoint,
we can construct a vehicle tracker that publishes the underlying mutable state without undermining thread safety,
as shown in the PublishingVehicleTracker class in Listing 4.12.
