/*
Listing 7.2 shows a sample use of this class that lets the prime generator run for one second before cancelling it.
The generator wonâ€™t necessarily stop after exactly one second,
since there may be some delay between the time that cancellation is requested and
the time that the run loop next checks for cancellation.

The cancel method is called from a finally block to ensure that the prime generator
is cancelled even if the call to sleep is interrupted.
If cancel were not called, the prime-seeking thread would run forever,
consuming CPU cycles and preventing the JVM from exiting.
