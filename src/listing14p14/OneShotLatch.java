/*
OneShotLatch in Listing 14.14 is a binary latch implemented using AQS. It has two public methods, await and signal,
that correspond to acquisition and release. Initially, the latch is closed;
any thread calling await blocks until the latch is opened. Once the latch is opened by a call to signal,
waiting threads are released and threads that subsequently arrive at the latch will be allowed to proceed.

In OneShotLatch, the AQS state holds the latch state - closed (zero) or open (one).
The await method calls acquireSharedInterruptibly in AQS,
which in turn consults the tryAcquireShared method in OneShotLatch.
The tryAcquireShared implementation must return a value indicating whether or not acquisition can proceed.
If the latch has been previously opened, tryAcquireShared returns success, allowing the thread to pass;
otherwise it returns a value indicating that the acquisition attempt failed.
The acquireSharedInterruptibly method interprets failure to mean that
the thread should be placed on the queue of waiting threads.
Similarly, signal calls releaseShared,  which causes tryReleaseShared to be consulted.
The tryReleaseShared implementation unconditionally sets the latch state to open and
indicates (through its return value) that the synchronizer is in a fully released state.
This causes AQS to let all waiting threads attempt to reacquire the synchronizer,
and acquisition will now succeed because tryAcquireShared returns success.

OneShotLatch is a fully functional, usable, performant synchronizer, implemented in only twenty or so lines of code.
Of course, it is missing some useful features - such as timed acquisition or the ability to inspect the latch state -
but these are easy to implement as well,
since AQS provides timed versions of the acquisition methods and utility methods for common inspection operations.

OneShotLatch could have been implemented by extending AQS rather than delegating to it,
but this is undesirable for several reasons. Doing so would undermine the simple (two-method) interface of OneShotLatch,
and while the public methods of AQS won't allow callers to corrupt the latch state,
callers could easily use them incorrectly.  None of the synchronizers in java.util.concurrent extends AQS directly -
they all delegate to private inner subclasses of AQS instead.
