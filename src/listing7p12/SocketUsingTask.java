/*
SocketUsingTask implements CancellableTask and defines Future.cancel to close the socket as well as call super.cancel.
If a SocketUsingTask is cancelled through its Future, the socket is closed and the executing thread is interrupted.
This increases the taskâ€™s responsiveness to cancellation:
not only can it safely call interruptible blocking methods while remaining responsive to cancellation,
but it can also call blocking socket I/O methods.
