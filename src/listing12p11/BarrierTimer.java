/*
The primary extension we have to make to PutTakeTest is to measure the time taken for a run.
Rather than attempting to measure the time for a single operation, we get a more accurate measure by
timing the entire run and dividing by the number of operations to get a per-operation time.
We are already using a CyclicBarrier to start and stop the worker threads,
so we can extend this by using a barrier action that measures the start and end time, as shown in Listing 12.11.
