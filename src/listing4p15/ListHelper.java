/*
Listing 4.15 shows a putIfAbsent operation on a thread-safe List that correctly uses client-side locking.

If extending a class to add another atomic operation is fragile because
it distributes the locking code for a class over multiple classes in an object hierarchy,
client-side locking is even more fragile because it entails putting locking code for class C into classes that
are totally unrelated to C.

Exercise care when using client-side locking on classes that do not commit to their locking strategy.
Client-side locking has a lot in common with class extensionâ€”
they both couple the behavior of the derived class to the implementation of the base class.

Just as extension violates encapsulation of implementation,
client-side locking violates encapsulation of synchronization policy.
