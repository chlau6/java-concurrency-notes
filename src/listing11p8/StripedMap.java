/*
StripedMap in Listing 11.8 illustrates implementing a hash-based map using lock striping.
There are N_LOCKS locks, each guarding a subset of the buckets.
Most methods, like get, need acquire only a single bucket lock.
Some methods may need to acquire all the locks but, as in the implementation for clear,
may not need to acquire them all simultaneously.
