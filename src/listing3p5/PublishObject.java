/*
The most blatant form of publication is to store a reference in a public static field,
where any class and thread could see it.

The initialize method instantiates a new HashSet and publishes it by storing a reference to it into knownSecrets.

Publishing one object may indirectly publish others.
If you add a Secret to the published knownSecrets set, youâ€™ve also published that Secret,
because any code can iterate the Set and obtain a reference to the new Secret.
