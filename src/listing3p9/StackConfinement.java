/*
For primitively typed local variables, such as numPairs in loadTheArk,
you cannot violate stack confinement even if you tried.

There is no way to obtain a reference to a primitive variable,
so the language semantics ensure that primitive local variables are always stack confined.

Maintaining stack confinement for object references requires a little more assistance from the programmer
to ensure that the referent does not escape.

In loadTheArk, we instantiate a TreeSet and store a reference to it in animals.
At this point, there is exactly one reference to the Set,
held in a local variable and therefore confined to the executing thread.

However, if we were to publish a reference to the Set (or any of its internals),
the confinement would be violated and the animals would escape.
