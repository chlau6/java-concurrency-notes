/*
One way to induce an ordering on objects is to use System.identityHashCode,
which returns the value that would be returned by Object.hashCode.
Listing 10.3 shows a version of transferMoney that uses System.identityHashCode to induce a lock ordering.
It involves a few extra lines of code, but eliminates the possibility of deadlock.

In the rare case that two objects have the same hash code,
we must use an arbitrary means of ordering the lock acquisitions, and this reintroduces the possibility of deadlock.
To prevent inconsistent lock ordering in this case, a third “tie breaking” lock is used.
By acquiring the tie-breaking lock before acquiring either Account lock,
we ensure that only one thread at a time performs the risky task of acquiring two locks in an arbitrary order,
eliminating the possibility of deadlock (so long as this mechanism is used consistently).
If hash collisions were common, this technique might become a concurrency bottleneck
(just as having a single, program-wide lock would),
but because hash collisions with System.identityHashCode are vanishingly infrequent,
this technique provides that last bit of safety at little cost.

If Account has a unique, immutable, comparable key such as an account number, inducing a lock ordering is even easier:
order objects by their key, thus eliminating the need for the tie-breaking lock.
