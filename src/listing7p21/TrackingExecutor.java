/*
TrackingExecutor in Listing 7.21 shows a technique for determining which tasks were in progress at shutdown time.
By encapsulating an ExecutorService and instrumenting execute (and similarly submit, not shown) to remember
which tasks were cancelled after shutdown,
TrackingExecutor can identify which tasks started but did not complete normally.
After the executor terminates, getCancelledTasks returns the list of cancelled tasks.
In order for this technique to work, the tasks must preserve the threadâ€™s interrupted status when they return,
which well behaved tasks will do anyway.
